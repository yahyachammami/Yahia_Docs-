People might ignore your effort, doubt your capabilities, or pretend your progress is small.
But **don’t ever underestimate yourself you are better than the version of you that started this journey**, and that’s what truly counts.

Every step you take matters. Every hour you spend learning, building, and pushing forward brings you closer to the person you’re meant to be.
And trust me, one day you’ll look back and thank yourself for not giving up.
**Keep going. You’re already winning.**


> **Fuck Talan and Chekir and Fuck all those bastards 🖕 I was better than them, and I will always be.(same for you and your company) 😎🔥**
